More about me
=============

I was born on Feb 5, 1986, which means I'm turning 23 this year. I'm doing pretty well for my age: I am an expert in software architecture, know a hell lot of programming languages and technologies, have a plenty of industry experience and co-own a business.

However one can always achieve more. I'm falling somewhat behind in the competiion with the early years of Steve Job, whom I consider to be an example.

I have a 4.5 year old daughter. I am divorced, but living with my wife again. My personal life is a lot more complicated than that, though.

Novosibirsk, Russia is the center of Siberia, and also the city I live in. As you can guess it gets pretty cold in the winter here. I think I'll move to another country in maybe 5 or 10 years.


Bio from my company's web site
------------------------------

15 years have passed since Andrey was a proud DOS user, and he's been crazy about computer programming for all that time.

Andrey's experience ranges from GW-BASIC, through Assembler and standards-based C++ to Python, Ruby and Java. He has lead and failed his first multiperson project at the age of 16, and has learned a lot about managing software development since then.

Andrey has contributed the initial Ruby type inference code to the Eclipse Dynamic Languages Toolkit project and has then demoed it at EclipseCon 2007. Andrey has left the DLTK team afterwards and co-founded a company which aims at creating a new generation of IDEs and productivity tools for developers.

Currently Andrey is managing all kinds of activities the company has. He's mostly focused on Java and Eclipse world, though occasionally gets involved in Python and Ruby projects or has to apply his Win32 skills to some crazy JNIs.

Software development is the only thing Andrey is interested in, and occasional hobbies do not attract much attention. One certain thing is that he enjoys spending his free time with his wife and 4-year old daughter.
