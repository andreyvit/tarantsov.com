Are you considering a new project, but uncertain on the cost, the timeline, or other essential factors?

Working on a project is risky:

* What if the cost is higher than you’ve budgeted?
* What if the timeline is longer than you’re looking for?
* What if the steps involved are more complex than you’ve planned?
* What if you don’t enjoy working with the consultant?

The last thing you want is to start a project and find yourself spending thousands of dollars and not moving towards the outcome you’re looking for.


## What if you could reduce the risk around your project?

* Understand the cost to reach the outcomes you’re looking for
* Have clarity on the timeline for your project and the milestones along the way
* Understand the steps involved, individually and collectively
* Build a relationship with a consultant who prioritizes understanding your business and recommending the right solution for your particular situation


## Presenting: Tactical Roadmapping

A Tactical Roadmapping project is an opportunity for the two of us to meet, discuss your current situation, review the outcomes you’re looking for, and determine the best options to get you moving from where you are to where you want to be.

There are a number of benefits to starting work together with a Roadmapping Project:

* We begin bridging the gap between the outcomes you have in your head (more traffic, more sales, increased revenue, better image) and the projects to implement

* You walk away with a handful of new ideas (as a result of us working together) that will get you even closer to the outcomes you’re looking for.

* You reduce the risk surrounding your project by discussing the outcomes you’re looking for, your current situation, and any risks or assumptions surrounding the project.

When we work together on a Roadmapping Project for your business, we’re working together to provide you with expert advice and direction.

**My job is to give you direction on your project so you know if what you’re planning on doing is what you actually need to do.**

At the completion of the Tactical Roadmapping, you’ll receive a number of deliverables to help enhance your understanding of the project you need:

* An overview summarizing the major takeaways of our meeting
* A technical specification of the app/system, including:
    * Feature set and priorities
    * Rough wireframes for communication purposes (not an actual design)
    * Non-functional requirements (security, performance, compatibility, availability, compliance, accessibility, etc)
* A recording of our conversation for you to reference
* A written report offering my insight and expertise on the best options for your business as you move forward (technical details, timeline, costs)
* A proposal for implementing the best options for your business

Most importantly, the deliverables from this roadmapping project are portable.


## What you receive will get you closer to where you need to be

We'd do all of this as part of working on the project anyway.

I promise that once you apply, my goal is to help you determine if working together is the right investment for your business, not hard-sell you on something that you don’t need.


## How does a Roadmapping Project work?

**Step 1. Questionnaire.** Once you pay, you’ll receive a questionnaire to fill out about your business, the project you want to build and the outcomes you’re looking to achieve.

**Step 2. Strategic Discovery.** After that, we’ll schedule a time for us to have an in-depth 90-minute ‘Strategic Discovery’ conversation about your project, and your business, and the outcomes you’re looking for.

On the call, I’ll contribute my insight to your available options and answer any questions you have.

After our call, I’ll research the situation you’re experiencing and the outcomes you’re looking for.

I’ll put together a report for you and your business. In this report, I’ll summarize the major takeaways from our meeting and contribute my insight and expertise to the different options at hand for your business and best path for you to follow to achieve your intended outcomes.

You can expect to receive your report within 5 business days of our meeting.

## Common Questions

In this section you address any common objection in the form of a frequently asked questions list. If possible, use actual questions from past clients or prospects. If you don’t have clients or prospects, questions from friends who have reviewed the page for you are better than nothing. Try not to make questions up yourself - made up FAQs usually come across as phoney and self-serving.

## What’s unique about a Roadmapping Project?

Unlike other consultants who offer a free consultation before sending you a proposal, with a Roadmapping Project you’re assured that our work together gets the same attention that any other paying project receives.

Additionally, you can rest easily known that my recommendations on how you should proceed are based on a detailed discussion about your business, your goals, and your current situation. This allows me to fully understand the situation you’re experiencing and the outcomes you’re looking for.

A ‘free proposal’ without necessary research is, at best, guesswork. At worst, it could be like going hiking on a new trail without a map: at best, it takes twice as long and costs more than expected.


## Take action now

Roadmapping Projects are only $3000.
