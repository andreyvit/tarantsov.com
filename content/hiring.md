# Bubblehouse is hiring

_TLDR: We are looking for principal-level (i.e. “beyond senior”) engineers who share our pragmatic values for a fully-remote position paying around $200–250k/yr._

Bubblehouse is a fast-growing custom and private loyalty platform. Headquartered in NYC, the entire team is fully remote and spread across US and Europe. We power loyalty programs for large brands, including household names.

We’re again expanding our lean team of extremely experienced developers. Companies are switching from other platforms thanks to the customizations and flexibility that we offer, enabled by our pace and technical excellence, which we intend to keep for years to come.

Tech-wise, we’re running on Golang, and using custom database engine on top of local key-value stores, colocating the storage and compute on dedicated hardware servers, and reading data directly from mmap’ed pages of the database. Ever came across HN saying that one can run Twitter on a single machine these days? We’re doing that in production.

Zero lines of React, almost zero third-party dependencies (carefully vetted), every line of JavaScript manually written with respect and understanding of the web platform. We render HTML server-side like it’s 2005.

We do have to integrate with a whole zoo of systems and APIs, so you will occasionally be stepping into the shoes of less fortunate developers in small bursts (say hi to Shopify React components for checkout extensions).

Looking for:

1. Top to bottom understanding of the software stack, from the modern-ish web platform to CPU caches. Significant web experience is a must, although it does not have to be any of the newfangled stuff.

2. Thinking and problem solving outside the box. (We don’t _always_ go for unconventional solutions, but we do it often enough to require a person who can do justice considering the entire problem space at every step.)

3. Demonstrated ability and hunger to learn new things quickly. (Every month we’re doing things we have never done before.)

4. Broad experience across multiple programming paradigms, platforms and software stacks. We're expecting around 15–25 years of intense varied experience.

5. Demonstrated care for the software craftsmanship (which can take many forms, including mentoring, writing, teaching, open-source projects and contributions, and simply deeply-held beliefs communicated well).

6. Great spoken English, and ability to communicate 9am to noon in New York time zone.

We give you a literally fast-paced environment (with features delivered in days) where you need to solve very challenging problems with practical advanced technology, take on entrenched market leaders, and help entrepreneurs across small and large businesses delight their fans. Our pay is in $200–$250k/yr range, all cash, with a possibility of equity in the future.

We are straightforward, driven, personal, and a little messy. We all _care_, and we expect you to care too.

Send a plain text cover letter to [andrey+hiring@bubblehouse.com](mailto:andrey+hiring@bubblehouse.com). Help us see how you stand out. Summarize your experience. Link to 1–5 impressive things you’ve built and are proud of, link to where we can see some of your code, include your portfolio/CV, describe the platforms and stacks you’re an expert in. How did you start programming? What are you most passionate about in technology? What are the most interesting or weird things you’ve done? What are your strongest held professional opinions? Please make your email easy to read, we’ll appreciate that.

(If you have applied before, no need to re-apply unless your circumstances have changed significantly.)
