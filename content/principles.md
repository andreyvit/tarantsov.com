# My professional principles

## Fast-moving businesses are my clients

I've always collaborated with companies and groups that work at a high pace with low overhead:

- startups
- fast-growing companies
- strategic initiative teams within larger enterprises

These days I'm a technical director of a startup called [Bubblehouse](/bubblehouse/).


## Here are my principles

I build differently:

### Timelessness instead of churn

Churn is the first enemy of a lean business.

* Don't break things that work.
* Avoid depending on technologies that break things regularly.

You should be able to go back to a project in a couple of years, and still find it easy to run and maintain.


### Foresight

I believe in *foresight* and building with end goal in mind.

This is opposite to the “do the simplest thing that could possibly work” approach popularized by the Extreme Programming movement. The days of waterfalls are long gone, and I personally believe in striking a healthy balance between effort minimization and foresight.

Every action one takes should be a step on a longer journey.


### Details matter

I adore *details* and respect edge cases.

Many people like to ignore edge cases because they're rarely very significant to the business side of things. However, I find that considering edge cases helps in gaining a deeper understanding of the nature of the thing you are trying to build.


### Dependencies are evil

Solving a generic problem is *much* harder than solving a specific narrow problem. When a team is senior enough, the default choice should often be to avoid using third-party libraries and frameworks outside of a small, battle-tested set.


### Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

Keep things as simple as possible. This leaves the necessary clarify and space to handle heaps of justified complexity where it matters.


### Small teams always win

I hate inefficiencies, and prefer small teams of extremely competent world-class professionals.

Overhead, misunderstandings, meetings and churn are the enemies of fast-moving businesses.
