Will get your MVP launched in a month. How do I know? Because I’ve launched multiple, for clients ranging from tiny startups to the largest US companies.

* Minimum viable version of your app idea to production in four weeks.
* Bringing “whatever it takes” to the table. Consequat nostrud reprehenderit commodo occaecat non excepteur cupidatat cupidatat amet do aliqua culpa aliquip reprehenderit.

* [Fixed schedule](http://www.example.com/)
* fixed cost: https://duckduckgo.com/
* semi-fixed feature set (we’ll define primary and stretch goals).

I’ll build a **pragmatic** system that can *grow over time*, and my team can handle further development if you wish. So we’re absolutely not talking about a throwaway prototype.

## Roadmapping

We’ll get started with a Tactical Roadmapping session. Over a couple of days, I’ll work with you closely to evaluate your idea, define the minimum viable product, and spell out the exact execution steps and the timeline.

## FAQ

### Is four weeks really enough?

In almost every case, **it is enough** to get a viable product launched to either general public or beta testers.

Some complex projects involving *artificial intelligence*, legacy systems, extensive third-party integrations, regulatory requirements or corporate politics may require 8–12 weeks to reach a viable version. If this is your case, we’ll talk a lot more about that during the Roadmapping session.

### Are you a one-man shop?

No. **I involve experts and associates as needed.** However, I’ll do 90–95% of the initial MVP development myself.

Why? Throughout my career, I found myself to be at least 4x more productive in complex tasks than my peers in senior positions. As part of your MVP, I’ll build a solid architectural foundation for further development, which can then be either handled by my team or handed off to yours.

I will, of course, hand off some mundane tasks to my associates, and will involve help from people studying new AI papers all day long, if your project happens to involve AI.

I found this approach to bring the most value to my clients.

### What about further development after launch?

We can handle that, or we can hand that off to your team, whatever you prefer. (We, of course, like to maintain our babies, but we understand the need to let go.)

I’ll get you all the details on this as part of our Roadmapping session.

### Will you launch my artificial intelligence project in a month as well?

Yes, if the AI part is just around the hot-dog-or-not level, that is, can be solved using the currently widespread battle-tested production approaches.

No, if the AI part involves a significant amount of research and cannot be trimmed down for the initial version. I won’t be able to commit to a fixed price and a fixed schedule in that case, and will instead propose our Marathon Development process.

### Do you do blockchain development?

I can certainly do it, but we probably won’t need to. The blockchain tech is often misunderstood and misused. Most people chasing a “blockchain” are looking for some, but not all of its features, which allows for simpler and more predictable (not to mention cost-effective) systems.

We’ll work together to figure out what your project actually needs, and will build exactly that.

### Is there something you don’t do?

We won’t do 3D games and anything illegal. We may reject projects on moral grounds as well, so won’t help you chase down dissidents in a totalitarian regime.
