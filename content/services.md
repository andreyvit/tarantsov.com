## Fast-moving businesses are my clients

I help startups, fast-growing businesses and strategic initiative teams within enterprises to build the future and move fast on things that matter.


## I build differently

I use *pragmatic* and timeless technologies, so we won't be chasing endless churn.

I believe in *thinking deeply* in parallel to *taking action*, so we'll never lose sight of longer-term goals.

I adore *details* and respect edge cases.

I avoid *dependencies* where possible, so we'll exercise full control over our project.

I believe in *foresight* and building with end goal in mind, rather than only focusing on short-term needs. Every action we take will be a step of a longer journey.

I like to keep things as simple as possible, but will handle heaps of justified complexity where it matters.


## I lead small teams

You won't be hiring a team of 20. One to three ultra-competent developers is my target for most teams. They can do more than those 20 developers companies typically have.

Overhead, misunderstandings, meetings and churn are the enemies of fast-moving businesses.


## The process

We'll meet to see if we're a good fit for each other.

Then we'll do a deep dive into your project in a _tactical roadmapping session_. You provide a business _strategy_, and I'll work with you to create the best _tactical plan_. We'll analyze your situation, desired outcomes, assets and constraints, and I'll use my expertise to make a detailed technical blueprint for achieving the results you need.

Then you can use my _turnkey development service_ to bring the best execution to our excellent plan.
